    Kino’s last concert took place on June 24 1990, Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Approximately 70,000 people visited the stadium even though it was rainy that day. It was the last concert on band's nationwide tour but no one knew that it would be their last.</p> 
	On August 15 1990, Victor Tsoi passed away in a car crash that shocked the band and their fans to the point where some of the Kino fans took their own lives in response.
	This video is part of that concert where the band plays Gruppa Krovi, their most iconic song.

  <p>
    Voyna!(War!) is a song released in 1986 as part of the band's album "Nachalnik Kamchatki" (The Chief of Kamchatka).
  </p>
  <p>
  The song's lyrics are a critique of war and violence, focusing on the absurdity and destructiveness of conflict. The chorus, which repeats "Voyna!" ("War!"), highlights the song's main theme of the chaotic and relentless nature of war, while the verses reflect on how it affects individuals and society.The lyric "Between Earth and Heaven, there is war!" symbolizes that war always existed as part of the human nature and carries on as time passes by.
  </p>
  <p>
  Though it's not an explicitly reflected as an anti-Soviet song, "Voyna" symbolized a call for peace and a condemnation of conflict, especially the senselessness of war that affects ordinary people. Tsoi's lyrics often had a poetic, symbolic quality, and "Voyna" is no exception, using imagery and emotional appeals to make a powerful statement about the horrors of war while accepting that it's part of human nature.
  </p>
  <p>
  This footage is from a concert in 1988 where the band sang Voyna.

  <p>
  Spokoynaya Noch" (which means "Good Night" in Russian) is a song by Kino, one of the most influential rock bands from Russia.
  </p>
  <p>
  The song has a very poetic and somewhat haunting message. It talks about a sense of finality, the end of an era, and the inevitability of change. The lyrics reflect a bittersweet acceptance of the moment, mixed with the desire for peace.
  </p>
  <p>
  Spokoynaya Noch was played in CSKA Arena, Moscow as part of a reunion concert of Kino where Yuri Kasparyan, Igor Tikhomirov, Georgy Guryanov, Aleksei Rybin and Oleg Valinsky performed together.
